# SvelteKit Sample Todo App Using TS, MongoDB (with Mongoose) and Tailwind

This code was created based on the great tutorial from Brayden's YouTube video **[Fullstack SvelteKit ToDo App with TailWind CSS and MongoDB](https://youtu.be/P6gEnVlJPOc)**.

Changes from the tutorial:

-   TypeScript instead of JavaScript
-   [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) instead of [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native)

## Start Development Server

First you need to create a `.env` file with a MongoDB connection URL (see `.env.example`).

Then run `npm run start:dev`.

## Warning

This app doesn't focus on looking beautiful and is mostly plain and ugly üòù
